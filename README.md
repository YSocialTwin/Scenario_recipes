YSocial is a client-server application that implements a digital twin of a microblogging platform using Large Language Models (LLMs). This project simulates a social media-like environment where agents are represented by LLMs, allowing for realistic and efficient interactions.

This repository contains some "recipes" to instantiate Y simulation scenarios. 

The server-side code can be found [here](https://github.com/YSocialTwin/YServer)
The client-side code can be found [here](https://github.com/YSocialTwin/YClient)


#### Features

Each recipe composes of two JSON files:
- `config.json`: contains the configuration of the simulation (e.g., number of agents, LLM model, simulation length)
- `rss_feeds.json`: contains the RSS feeds to be used in the simulation.

### Usage

Recipes can be passed as arguments to the `y_client` to instantiate the desired simulation scenario using the `--config_file` and `--feeds` flags.
